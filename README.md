# Data-pagination-and-filtering
 This is my second project project in the techdegree course.
 In this project, I dynically inserted HTML elements via Javascript.
 I created one function where it would dynamically insert student items via a for loop.

 I created another function that would create a number of buttons depeneding on how many student items there were in total. These buttons were created using HTML literals and dynimcally inserted via Javascript.
